Tetris game made in React.
The design is responsive, but the game itself is not playable without a keyboard.  (I might add mobile functionality later on)

Use the right/left arrow keys for moving. 
Use the up arrow key to rotate. 
Use the spacebar to drop the element.

Feel free to use/learn the code however you wish.
